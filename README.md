# HouseMate
HouseMate makes it easy to set-up reminders, notes & switches for a shared household. It aims to create a sleek and easy experience with no sign-up required, easy join codes/links and a fast, responsive experience on mobile devices.

I plan to adapt this into a "native" app using something like Cordova.
